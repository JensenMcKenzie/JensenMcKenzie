# Jensen McKenzie's Projects
## Info
Most of these projects are school related, but each project focuses on a core aspect of each language.
Whether that be inheritance, gui development, algorithm deployment, artificial intelligence, or machine
learning. Each of these projects represents an important idea, all of which I am able to use to
develop and distribute anything.
